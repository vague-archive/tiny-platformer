# Void Tiny Platformer

> WARNING: this game plays terrible with current painter, the paint function
takes > 40ms to render which makes the game unplayable.

This is an example game built with the `@vaguevoid/sdk` of a basic platform game.
You control a little box and must collect the gold boxes, and jump on the monster boxes.

```bash
> bun install  # install dependencies
> bun run dev  # run the game
```
